# docker-dev-env-for-symfony

This repository contains the basic configuration for a complete local environment for Symfony projects

### Content:
- NGINX 1.19 container to handle HTTP requests
- PHP 8.0.1 container to host your Symfony application
- MySQL 8.0 container to store databases

(feel free to update any version in `Dockerfiles` and ports in `docker-compose.yml`)

### Installation:
- Run `make build` to create all containers
- Enter the PHP container with `make ssh-be`
- Install your favourite Symfony version with `composer create-project symfony/skeleton project [version (e.g. 5.2.*)]`
- Move the content to the root folder with `mv project/* . && mv project/.env .`. This is necessary since Composer won't install the project if the folder already contains data.
- Copy the content from `project/.gitignore` and paste it in the root's folder `.gitignore`
- Remove `project` folder (not needed anymore)
- Navigate to `localhost:1000` so you can see the Symfony welcome page :)

Happy coding!
